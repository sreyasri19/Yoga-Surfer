            Utthita Trikonasana is a quintessential standing pose that stretches and strengthens the whole body.

            Utthita Trikonasana, it’s helpful to remember that there’s a reason for the name of the pose: In it, your body forms various-sized 
            triangles—the larger triangle between your front and back legs and the floor as well as the smaller triangle between your arm, front 
            leg or the mat, and side body.Utthita Trikonasana brings

            Utthita Trikonasana brings about grounded stability and a heart-opening expansion of the chest. It stretches the hamstrings and back m
            uscles while activating the abdominal muscles. It’s a pose that requires concentration, body awareness, balance, and a steady breath, 
            which can help focus a wandering mind and bring you back to what’s happening on your mat.

            Steps:
            From Tadasana (Mountain Pose), step your feet 3 to 4 feet apart. Raise your arms parallel to the floor and reach them actively to the 
            sides, shoulder blades wide, palms down.
            
            Turn your left foot in slightly and your right foot forward to face the front of the mat. Align your right heel with your left heel if
            that’s comfortable for you. Engage your quads.

            Exhale and extend your torso forward—bending from your hip joint, not the waist—to reach your side body directly over your front leg.
            Counter the reach by anchoring your left hip to the left. (Imagine someone is trying to pull your hips to the left.) Ground this movement
            by strengthening the left leg and pressing the outer heel firmly to the floor.

            When you have reached as far as you are able, hinge at the hip and bring the torso to the right, moving toward your upper body being
            parallel to the floor. Reach your right hand down toward the floor and stretch your left arm toward the ceiling, in line with the tops
            of your shoulders. Your hands, arms and shoulders will form a  straight line, perpendicular to your mat.

            Open your torso to the left, keeping the left and right sides of the torso equally long. Let the left hip come slightly forward and 
            lengthen the tailbone toward the back heel.

            Rest your right hand on your shin, ankle, or the floor outside your right foot—whatever is possible without distorting the sides of the
            torso. Keep your head in a neutral position or turn to look up at your hand or down at the ground.

            Stay in this pose for 30 to 60 seconds. Inhale to come up, strongly pressing the back heel into the floor and reaching the top arm 
            toward the ceiling. Recenter, then reverse the feet and repeat for the same length of time on the other side.

            Benefits: Extended Triangle Pose improves balance, posture, and body awareness. It counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting.
