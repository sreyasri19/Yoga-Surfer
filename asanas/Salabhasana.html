                Salabhasana or Locust Pose effectively preps beginners for deeper backbends, strengthening the back of the torso, legs, and arms.

                Salabhasana takes some back and abdominal strength, plus mental fortitude to hold the pose. Focus on lengthening your spine and distributing 
                the backbend evenly through your upper, middle, and lower back. No crunching that lumbar area! Engaging all of your back muscles instead of 
                just those in your lower back will help open your chest and shoulders. Building up strength and stretching your chest not only feel good to
                those of us that spend most of our days hunched over our computers, but will also result in better posture.

                Steps:
                Begin on your belly with your feet together and your hands reaching back, palms down.
                Extend your big toes straight back and press down with all ten toenails to activate your quadriceps.
                Rotate your inner thighs to the ceiling to broaden your lower back.
                Keeping your hands lightly on the mat, raise your head and chest and your legs, leading with your inner thighs.
                Roll your shoulders back and up away from the floor. Keep the back of your neck long and emphasize lifting your sternum instead of lifting your chin. 
                Donâ€™t grip your glutes.
                To come out of the pose, slowly release.

                Benefits: Locust Pose improves posture and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting. It may help relieve lower back pain and can 
                counteract slouching and kyphosis (abnormal curvature of the spine).
