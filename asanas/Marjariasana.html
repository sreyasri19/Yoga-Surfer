                The Marjariasana yoga is also called the cat pose, where the word “marjari” means cat and “asana” means pose.

                This yoga posture is inspired by the cat stretch, giving your body the ever-relaxing feline stretch. It looks 
                simple, but you will see how beneficial it is to the body as well as the mind.

                Before you do the Marjariasana yoga, it’s important to gradually prepare your body for the stretch. In any 
                yoga routine, a stretch like this starts with a ‘Child Pose’, also known as Balasana Yoga. 

                Steps:
                Get on all fours, like a cat. Shoulder over wrists and hips over knees, with your weight evenly distributed along with 
                your hands and knees.
                Start with a neutral spine. Focus on a point in front of you.
                Inhale and expand the belly toward the floor. Raise your chin and tilt your head backward toward the spine. Point the 
                tailbone up as you stretch like a cat.
                Then exhale and pull the belly button in, towards the spine. The chin should rest on the chest and direct your vision 
                toward the nose. Your back should be rounded.
                Complete as many rounds as you’d like, working toward a fluid movement that stretches and relaxes your spine.

                Benefits:
                It is very good for the spine as it stretches the backbone and strengthens it while also improving its flexibility.
                The asana strengthens your wrists.
                Marjariasana benefits the shoulders by making them stronger.
                The movements in the asana massage your digestive organs and activate them. As a result, the process of digestion is improved.
                It helps tone the abs by getting rid of excess fat from around your hips.
                Since the asana requires you to be on all your fours, it enhances blood circulation as well as oxygen flow through the body.
                The cat stretch soothes the mind, thus helping you get rid of unnecessary stress and anxiety.
                The asana also aids in digestion and increased metabolism. 
                This is also beneficial for those aiming for height growth or an improved posture.
                For women, the asana can soothe menstrual cramps and stiffness.
