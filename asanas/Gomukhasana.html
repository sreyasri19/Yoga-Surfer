                Gomukhasana (Cow Face Pose) stretches your entire body—your shoulders and arms, your ankles, hips, thighs and back. In the pose, 
                the folded legs are said to resemble a cow’s mouth; the elbows form the shape of a cow’s ears.

                It’s a pose that allows you many opportunities to explore the symmetry of the body. When you cross one knee over the other, notice a 
                difference in how it feels right over left versus left over right. Similarly, the arm position will tell you instantly if one  shoulder is
                tighter than the other.
                
                Another thing to pay attention to in Gomukhasna  is the length and position of your back, neck, and head.  You can practice bringing length 
                to the spine all the way up through your neck to your skull. When bringing the upper arm close to the face, students tend to bend the neck and lean the 
                head to the side. Be mindful to keep the spine straight. 
                
                Use props to make this pose more accessible. If tight shoulders make it difficult to clasp your fingers together behind your back in Cow Face Pose,
                use a strap. You may sit on a block or blankets to give your legs more space to move into the pose.

                Steps :
                Start in Dandasana (Staff Pose), then cross your right leg over your left, stacking knee on top of knee and bringing your right heel to the 
                outside of your left hip.
                Bend your left knee, bringing your left heel to the outside of your right hip.
                With your knees stacked and centered, press down evenly with your sitting bones.
                Elongate your spine and lift out of your lower back.
                Inhale, take your right arm out to the side and rotate it so your palm faces back and your thumb points down.
                As you exhale, bend your elbow and bring your right arm behind your back, with your palm facing out and the upper arm pulled in close to your body.  
                Your elbow points towards your sacrum and your right fingers point towards the base of your neck.
                With your next inhale, take your left arm out to the side and up to the ceiling with your hand facing the midline.
                Bend your left elbow and reach your hand down toward your neck. Bring your elbow in close to your face and up toward the ceiling as your hand reaches 
                down the spine.
                Reach your hands toward each other until they touch.  Clasp hands or fingers if possible.
                To exit the pose, exhale and carefully release your arms out to your sides and return to Dandasana.
                Repeat on the opposite side.
