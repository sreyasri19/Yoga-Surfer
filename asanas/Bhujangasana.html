                Bhujangasana (Cobra Stretch) comes from the word bhujanga meaning cobra or snake and asana meaning pose. Bhujangasana is also known as 
                Cobra Stretch. This pose is included in Suryanamaskar (Sun Salutations Pose) as well as Padma Sadhana. 
                
                Bhujangasana or Cobra Stretch is a solution to solve these and many other problems, just sitting (or lying down) at home! Bhujangasana, 
                the Cobra Pose, is a pose that you do while lying down on your stomach. It gives your body (especially the back), a good stretch that melts 
                your stress away almost instantly!
                
                Steps:
                Lie down on your stomach with your toes flat on the floor, soles facing upwards; rest your forehead on the ground.
                Keep your legs close together, with your feet and heels lightly touching each other.
                Place both hands in such a way that palms are touching ground under your shoulders, elbows should be parallel and close to your torso. 
                Taking a deep breath in, slowly lift your head, chest and abdomen. Keep your navel on the floor.
                Pull your torso back and off the floor with the support of your hands. Make sure that you are putting equal pressure on both the palms.
                Keep breathing with awareness, as you curve your spine, vertebra by vertebra. If possible, straighten your arms by arching your back as 
                much as possible; tilt your head back and look up 
                Maintain the pose while breathing evenly for 4-5 breaths. 
                Now, breathe out, and gently bring your abdomen, chest, and head back to the floor and relax.
                Repeat 4-5 times.
