                There are several forward bend poses in yoga that help in stretching and strengthening our back and core area, the two 
                main parts necessary for not only maintaining our health but also for making the smallest of the movements.

                One such very important pose is Padahastasana that has been practiced for thousands of years. Padahastasana meaning ‘hand 
                to foot pose’ involves draping of the upper body over the legs and drawing our mind inward. It is an easy pose of yoga for
                beginners and is also a form of hatha yoga as a part of Surya Namaskar yoga. Padahastasana yoga steps are also done to regulate 
                and remove the excess air or ‘vata’ from the body and cure its imbalances. 

                Steps:
                Do a 5-minute warm-up session before beginning Padahastasana steps.
                Stand straight on a comfortable yoga mat. Your hands should be on your sides and chest open.
                Inhale slowly and raise your hands straight over the head. Make sure that your biceps are touching your ears and elbows are straight while you are doing so.
                Remember to keep your body straight and firm but not stiff.
                Turn both your palms forward, exhale, and gently start bending your body forward using your lower back. 
                Make a 90-degree angle with your upper body and legs and touch your abdomen with the thighs and chest with your legs.
                Keep your hands beside the feet and touch your forehead to the knees.
                Ensure that you keep your legs as straight as possible and breathe deeply.
                Hold this position for 15-30 seconds.
                Gently lift your forehead followed by the hands and come back to the starting position.
                Do Padahastasana 5-6 times, 2-3 times in a day.
