                Balasana is not only a resting or calming pose, but it also provides a great stretch for your back and hips.

                Kneel on the floor. Touch your big toes together and sit on your heels, then separate your knees about as wide as your hips. 
                Exhale and lay your torso down between your thighs.
                
                Broaden your sacrum across the back of your pelvis and narrow your hip points toward the navel, so that they nestle down onto the inner thighs. 
                Lengthen your tailbone away from the back of the pelvis while you lift the base of your skull away from the back of your neck. Rest your forehead on the mat.
                
                Stretch your arms forward with your palms down and fingers spread wide. Rest here for anywhere from a few breaths to a few minutes.
