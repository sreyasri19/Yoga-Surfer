                Uttanasana will wake up your hamstrings and soothe your mind.

                Uttanasana (Standing Forward Bend) may be one of the very first postures a new yogi learns. It’s also one of the most misinterpreted or
                misunderstood.
                
                Standing Forward Bend — Uttanasana (OOT-un-AA-SUN-aa) — is a posture that stretches entire body and can be adjusted to increase or decrease
                levels of intensity in the hamstrings. The pose gets its name from the Sanskrit words, Ut, meaning intensity, tan, meaning to stretch or 
                extend, and asana, meaning pose

                Steps:
                Begin in Tadasana (Mountain Pose) at the front of the mat with your hands at your hips.
                Bend your knees slightly and fold your torso over your legs, hingeing from the hips, not the lower back.
                Your hands may land next to your feet or on the ground in front of you.
                Inhale and extend your chest to lengthen your spine.
                Exhale and gently press both legs toward straight without hyperextending. Lift the kneecaps and gently spiral your upper, inner thighsback.
                On an exhalation, extend your torso down without rounding your back. Lengthen your neck, extending the crown of your head 
                toward the ground, while you draw your shoulders down your back toward your hips.

                Benefits: 
                Standing Forward Bend can improve your body awareness and balance. As a calming and relaxing pose, it can help you manage 
                stress as it activates the relaxation response (your parasympathetic nervous system) and deactivates the stress response 
                (your sympathetic nervous system). This pose also stretches the back side of your body, including your back and shoulders,
                buttocks (glutes), back of your thighs (hamstrings), calf muscles, and the soles of your feet.
