                The foundation of all standing poses, Mountain Pose makes a great a starting position, resting pose, or tool to improve posture.

                Though Tadasana (Mountain Pose) might seem simple, it is actually an essential pose for your yoga practice. It is considered the 
                foundation for the many other standing poses in yoga.

                There’s actually a lot to pay attention to in this seemingly straightforward pose. In Mountain Pose, you stand upright with your feet 
                facing forward parallel to each other and your arms at your sides, palms facing forward. Because this pose requires you to keep the shoulders open and down, away from the ears, it promotes good posture. The empowering nature of Tadasana also enhances stability.

                Steps:
                Stand with the feel parallel, a few inches apart. (Alternately you may stand with the bases of your big toes touching, heels slightly 
                apart.

                Lift and spread your toes and the balls of your feet, then lay them softly back down on the floor. Rock gently back and forth and side
                to side. Gradually reduce this swaying to a standstill, with your weight balanced evenly across your feet. Feel the energy draw from 
                your feet up through your core.

                Without pushing your lower front ribs forward, lift the top of your sternum straight toward the ceiling. Widen your collarbones. 
                Allow your shoulder blades to draw toward each other and down the back, away from the ears.

                Let your arms relax beside your torso, palms facing in or forward.

                Balance the crown of your head directly over the center of your pelvis, with the underside of your chin parallel to the floor, throat 
                soft, and tongue wide and flat on the floor of your mouth. Soften your eyes. Breathe.

                Benefits:
                Mountain Pose is a grounding foundational posture that improves your postural and body awareness. This pose can also boost your energy
                and fight fatigue—a trait it shares with other standing poses. If you find yourself spending much of the day in front of a computer, 
                this pose can counter the effects of prolonged sitting and remind you of what proper alignment can feel like.
