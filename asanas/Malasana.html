                Garland Pose stretches just about everything around your lower back—quadriceps, groin, hips, and torso—as well as
                strengthens your ankles.

                Squat with your feet as close together as possible. Keep your heels grounded on the floor if you can. If not, roll up 
                your mat or put a towel under them. Separate your thighs slightly wider than your torso. Exhaling, lean your 
                torso forward and fit it snugly between your thighs.
                
                Press your elbows against your inner knees, bringing your palms to together in Anjali Mudra (Salutation Seal), and resist
                the knees into the elbows to help lengthen your front torso. Hold for 30–60 seconds.

                Benefits:
                Opens your hips and groin.
                Stretches your ankles, lower hamstrings, back and neck.
                Tones your abdominals.
                Aids in digestion.
                Strengthens your metabolism.
                Keeps your pelvic and hip joints healthy.
                Ideal for prenatal yoga.
