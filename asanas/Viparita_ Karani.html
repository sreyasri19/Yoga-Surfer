                Viparita Karani is often called Legs-up-the-Wall Pose, but viparita actually means “inverted,” and karani means “in action.” We can 
                interpret that to mean that the pose inverts the typical actions that happen in our bodies when we sit and stand. There are many 
                benefits to inverting the actions in your body. Here are a few. When you put your legs up the wall with your pelvis elevated on a folded
                blanket, lymph and other fluids that can lead to swollen ankles, tired knees, and congested pelvic organs flow into the lower belly; 
                this refreshes the legs and the reproductive area. This is healthy at any point in your reproductive life cycle.

                Steps:
                Lie down on a flat surface. Position yourself in a way that your tailbone is pointed at the base of the wall.
                Shimmy your hips as close as possible to the wall, then start walking your feet up the wall until your body forms an L shape.
                Make adjustments so that the posture feels relaxing, use a pillow under your head or a towel at the base of your back.

                Benefits:
