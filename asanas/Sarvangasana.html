                Sarvangasana comprises three words from Sanskrit, where "sarv" stands for all, "anga" for all of your bodily parts, and "asana" 
                for the position. It is also known as the shoulder stand pose. The entire body is used in this asana, which involves lying on your
                back and bending your legs at a 90-degree angle. Using your hands as support, you raise your hips off the ground, then balance your 
                complete body on your shoulders.

                Steps:
                Draw your feet close to your hips and curl your legs against your thighs as you exhale.
                With a gentle pull of the abdominal muscles and the support of the hands, elevate the lower part of the body vertically 
                (fingers under the hips and the thumbs above).
                The palms, elbows, neck, and back of the head should support the entire body weight (final position). Exhale as you complete
                the above actions in 4 seconds.
                Maintain this stance for as long as it is comfortable, but no more than two minutes, breathing slowly, rhythmically, and naturally.
                Return to the beginning position by inhaling and gently lowering the hips towards the mat, supported by the hands.
                Return to the beginning position by releasing the hands from behind you.
                Take a few deep breaths and then relax for a few moments before breathing normally.
