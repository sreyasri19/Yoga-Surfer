                Dhanurasana helps massage the abdominal organs, improves digestion, and strengthens the thighs, chest, and back. 
                It stretches your whole body, strengthens and tones your muscles with improved blood circulation.

                Steps :
                Lie on your stomach with your feet apart, in line with your hips, and your arms by the side of your body.
                Fold your knees, take your hands backward, and hold your ankles.
                Breathe in, and lift your chest off the ground and pull your legs up and towards the back. 
                Look straight ahead with a smile on your face.
                Keep the pose stable while paying attention to your breath. Your body is now curved and as taut as a bow.
                Continue to take long, deep breaths as you relax in this pose. But, bend only as far as your body permits you to. Do not overdo the stretch.
                After 15 -20 seconds, as you exhale, gently bring your legs and chest to the ground. Release the ankles and relax.
