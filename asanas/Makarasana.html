                Makarasana is a deeply restorative posture that is part of the Padma Sadhana sequence. Crocodile pose relaxes the entire nervous s
                ystem and is an excellent posture to use in between back strengthening poses. It gets its name from the Sanskrit words, Makara, 
                meaning crocodile, and asana, meaning pose.

                Steps:
                Lie on your belly, with the arms crossed under your head. Rest the forehead on the wrists of the hands.
                Close the eyes and let your whole body relax into the floor.  Let the heels turn out and let the legs flop open.
                Breathe deeply, pressing the belly down into the floor with each inhalation and hold for 6-10 breaths. With each exhalation allow 
                your body to relax deeper into the floor.
                To release: bring the palms under your shoulders and slowly press up into table or child pose or roll over onto your back.

                Benefits: Crocodile reduces stress and tension, promotes sleep, regulates blood pressure and reduces anxiety.
