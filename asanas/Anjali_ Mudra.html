                Anjali mudra is used as a posture of composure, of returning to one’s heart, whether you are greeting someone or saying goodbye,
                initiating or completing an action. As you bring your hands together at your center, you are literally connecting the right and left
                hemispheres of your brain. This is the yogic process of unification, the yoking of our active and receptive natures. In the yogic view
                of the body, the energetic or spiritual heart is visualized as a lotus at the center of the chest. Anjali mudra nourishes this lotus heart
                with awareness, gently encouraging it to open as water and light do a flower.

                Begin by coming into a comfortable sitting position like Sukhasana (Easy Pose). Lengthen your spine out of your pelvis and extend the 
                back of your neck by dropping your chin slightly in. Now, with open palms, slowly draw your hands together at the center of your chest
                as if to gather all of your resources into your heart. Repeat that movement several times, contemplating your own metaphors for bringing
                the right and left side of yourself—masculine and feminine, logic and intuition, strength and tenderness—into wholeness. Now, to reveal
                how potent the placement of your hands at your heart can be, try shifting your hands to one side or the other of your midline and pause
                there for a moment. Don’t you feel slightly off kilter? Now shift back to center and notice how satisfying the center line is, like a 
                magnet pulling you into your core. Gently touch your thumbs into your sternum (the bony plate at the center of the rib cage) as if you 
                were ringing the bell to open the door to your heart. Broaden your shoulder blades to spread your chest open from the inside. Feel space
                under your armpits as you bring your elbows into alignment with your wrists. Stay here for some time and take in your experience.
